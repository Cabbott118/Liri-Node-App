# Liri-Node-App

**LIRI** is like iPhone's **SIRI**. However, while **SIRI** is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, **LIRI** is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. **LIRI** will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

**LIRI** will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

As this app is run from the CLI, it takes user input in a systematic way and displays a response in the Command Line based on the user's input. 

To run this app yourself, you must aquire your own unique API keys.

Typing these inputs in the Command Line will yield something like:
**node liri concert-this <band name here>**

Typing these inputs in the Command Line will yield something like:
